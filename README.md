# Diabetes Prediction using Deep Neural Networks with TensorFlow.js

This project implements a deep neural network to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on physiological 
attributes such as age, weight, BMI, and blood pressure. The model is built using TensorFlow.js and employs a sequential 
architecture with multiple hidden layers. The network is trained on a dataset of patients and their corresponding 
diabetes diagnoses, utilizing the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss for binary classification.

Once trained, the model can predict whether a new patient is at risk of having diabetes, providing a probability score that 
can aid in medical decision-making. This project can be adapted for various other binary classification problems such as 
fraud detection or customer churn prediction.
